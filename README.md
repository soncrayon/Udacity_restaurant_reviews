Udacity FEND Project 5: Restaurant Reviews App
==============================================

For this project, we were asked to revise provided source code for a website to make the website responsive, ARIA-compliant, and loadable without web access (add a service worker for caching).  

Opening the Site
-----------------

Fork or clone the repository to your machine.
Open the index.html file.  

Apache License
---------------

I included a service worker from Apache and have included the required license in the file repo.
